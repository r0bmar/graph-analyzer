# graph-analyzer
Program that analyzes unweighted graphs from a text file.
Uses well-known graph algorithms like the Held-Karp, Kusaraju and Dijkstra algorithms.
Can find:
- shortest path between any two nodes
- the centers of a graph
- sets of strongly connected components
- a Hamiltonian path, if it exists. This is a path that goes through each node exactly once.
